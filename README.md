### This is a Practice Project created for understanding Spring Boot + Redis = Spring Data Redis, performing Basic CRUD Operations.

- In this project, I used redis as a Persistent Database.
- Redis can also be used as Cache Memory/In-Memory, for faster read and writes.(Check another Repository, used Redis as CacheMemory also)
- Redis can also be used as Pub/Sub Messageing and Data Replication, in form of Master-Slave Architecture.
